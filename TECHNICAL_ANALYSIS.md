# CryptoZombies DApp - Technical Analysis

## System Architecture Overview

The CryptoZombies DApp implements a decentralized application architecture consisting of three main layers:

1. **Smart Contract Layer** (Blockchain)
2. **Web3 Integration Layer** (JavaScript)
3. **User Interface Layer** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Contract Inheritance Hierarchy

```
Ownable
├── ZombieFactory
    ├── ZombieFeeding

## Network Configuration

### Development Environment

**Ganache Configuration:**
- Network ID: 5777
- RPC Port: 7545
- Gas Limit: 6,721,975
- Gas Price: 20 Gwei

**Truffle Configuration:**
```javascript
development: {
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 7545,
  network_id: "5777"
}
```

### MetaMask Integration

**Network Settings:**
- Custom RPC URL configuration
- Chain ID validation
- Currency symbol specification
- Account import from Ganache

## Data Flow Analysis

### 1. Zombie Creation Flow
```
User Input → Frontend Validation → MetaMask Sign → 
Smart Contract Execution → Event Emission → UI Update
```

### 2. Level Up Flow
```
User Click → ETH Payment → Transaction Confirmation → 
Contract State Change → Event Emission → UI Refresh
```

### 3. Transfer Flow
```
Owner Action → Approval Check → Transfer Execution → 
Ownership Update → Event Emission → UI Update
```

## Event System

### Smart Contract Events

#### 1. NewZombie Event
```solidity
event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);
```

#### 2. Transfer Event
```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
```

#### 3. AttackResult Event
```solidity
event AttackResult(bool attackResult, uint16 winCount, uint16 lossCount);
```

### Frontend Event Handling
```javascript
cryptoZombies.events.Transfer({ filter: { _to: userAccount } })
  .on("data", function (event) {
    // Update UI with new zombie
  })
  .on("error", console.error);
```
